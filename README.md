# Data
Dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

Data is broken into four broad groups that can be narrowed down into four topics: immunization, mortality, economic, and social.

The final script is found in ```scripts/FINAL_PROJECT_V3.ipynb```
<!-- 
## Immunization Score - Ryan
Pulled in an extra dataset for measles cases \
Score = avg(measles, polio, diphtheria) - will be a percentage.\
Remove outliers?

## Total Expenditure - Amanda
Remove 2015 data

## GDP - Zainab
Find another dataset

## Schooling - Jackson
Remove countries that do not have values for any year

## Presentation
Show a map with the life expectancy of each country \
Instead of showing *how* we created figures/charts, she wants to know
*why* we created the figures/charts. \
Get another dataset for map graph (for lat and long) \ 
Use *geopandas* \ 
Bubble Graph - Somehow animate the transition \
Correlation Matrix \

## Remaining Tasks
### Map w/GeoPandas - Zainab
### Use GDP (Animate transition between years) - 
### Correlation Matrix - 
### Start Slides (Google Slides) - 
### Combine Code - Ryan

## Slide content

### Questions
Lots of questions that coincide with our major question

### Data Issues
Import other datasets (BMI, GDP)\
Remove Outliers/null values \ 
Show examples of how that helped with the data\

### Life expectancy trends
Bar chart (developed vs developing)\
Map\
Overall life expectancy level \

### Going through all the columns
Find out which columns correlate directly with life expectancy \
- Schooling 
- Income Composition 
- Population 
- Thinness (5-9) 
- Thinness (1-19)
- Alcohol
- Total Expenditure
- Percentage Expenditure 
- GDP (Expenditure)
- BMI
- Immunization (broken down and overall score) 

### Correlation Matrix
Find which factors have a positive correlation with life expectancy - rank them\
